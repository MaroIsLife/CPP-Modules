There is a class Karen with at least the 5 functions required in the subject.
The function complain() executes the other functions using a pointer to them.
Ideally, the student should have implemented a way of matching the different
strings corresponding to the log level to the pointers of the corresponding
member function.
If the implementation is different but the exercise works you should mark it as valid.
The only thing that is not allowed is to have a if/elseif/else.
The student could have chosen to change the message Karen displays or to display
the examples given in the subject, both are valid.
